# Rock Meter for YARG
A BepInEx 6 mod for YARG v0.12.1+ that adds a Rock Meter and the ability to fail songs

Currently tested and working versions:
| Stable:  | Nightly |
|----------|---------|
| v0.12.1  | b2332   |

## Disclaimer
As this is a modification to the game, bugs may occur and performance may be slightly impacted.  Also, I'm not that great at coding, so if you can improve this, feel free to help out.

### While this mod and BepInEx are installed, please *DO NOT* report any bugs to YARC, *unless* you can reproduce them in the unmodded game!

## Known issues
- The mod currently only works properly with one player at a time, and only 5-fret guitar players, so please don't use this mod with multiple players or Drums! *(drums will be supported soonâ„¢)*
- There currently isn't a way to disable failing in-game without removing the plugin's DLL file

## Installation
1) Install [BepInEx 6.0.0-pre1](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v6.0.0-pre.1) to a ***portable installation*** of YARG.
    - You can download the latest nightly build of YARG [here](https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARG-BleedingEdge/releases) and then extract it to its own folder.
2) Download and extract the latest release of the mod from [Releases](https://github.com/YoShibyl/RockMeterYARG/releases)
3) Launch `YARG.exe`, and then load a song with only ONE (1) player active.
    - You should see the Rock Meter appear on the right side of the screen, somewhere below the score counter.  If not, then you didn't properly install the mod, or an update could have broken it.

### Uninstalling
To uninstall the mod, remove the following files and folders from the game's folder:
- `winhttp.dll`
- `doorstop_config.ini` *(optional)*
- The `BepInEx` folder *(optional)*
